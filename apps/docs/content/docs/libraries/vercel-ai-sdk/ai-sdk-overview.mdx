# Vercel AI SDK Overview

The **AI SDK** is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Why Use the AI SDK?

Integrating large language models (LLMs) into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK standardizes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models across supported providers, enabling developers to focus on building great AI applications without wasting time on technical details.

### Key Benefits

- **Unified Interface**: Switch between AI providers with minimal code changes
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, and Node.js
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for better developer experience
- **Streaming Support**: Built-in streaming for real-time AI responses
- **Tool Integration**: Easy integration with external tools and APIs

## Core Libraries

The AI SDK consists of two main libraries:

### AI SDK Core

A unified API for generating text, structured objects, tool calls, and building agents with LLMs.

**Key Functions:**
- `generateText` - Generate text and tool calls for non-interactive use cases
- `streamText` - Stream text and tool calls for interactive applications
- `generateObject` - Generate structured data matching a Zod schema
- `streamObject` - Stream structured objects for real-time UIs

### AI SDK UI

Framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interfaces.

**Key Hooks:**
- `useChat` - Real-time chat capabilities
- `useCompletion` - Text completions
- `useObject` - Streaming structured data
- `useAssistant` - Interactive assistant features

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install ai @ai-sdk/react
# Install OpenAPI-compatible provider for Ollama
npm install @ai-sdk/openai-compatible
```

### Basic Example

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';

const ollama = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'ollama',
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:11434/v1',
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: ollama('llama3.2'),
  prompt: 'What is the meaning of life?',
});

console.log(text);
```

## Supported Providers

The AI SDK supports multiple open-source and compatible providers:

- **OpenAPI Compatible**: Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI, vLLM, text-generation-webui
- **Self-Hosted Models**: Llama, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi
- **Open Platforms**: Groq, Together.ai, Fireworks, Replicate, Baseten
- **Hugging Face**: Inference API and Endpoints

## Use Cases

- **Chatbots**: Build conversational interfaces with streaming support
- **Content Generation**: Automate writing tasks and content creation
- **Data Extraction**: Extract structured information from unstructured text
- **Agents**: Create AI agents that can use tools to accomplish tasks
- **RAG Systems**: Build retrieval-augmented generation applications
- **Multi-Modal Apps**: Process text, images, PDFs, and more
