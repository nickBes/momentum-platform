# Drizzle ORM

Drizzle ORM is a headless TypeScript ORM with a head. 🐲

> Drizzle is a good friend who's there for you when necessary and doesn't bother when you need some space.

It looks and feels simple, performs on day _1000_ of your project, lets you do things your way, and is there when you need it.

**It's the only ORM with both relational and SQL-like query APIs**, providing you the best of both worlds when it comes to accessing your relational data.

Drizzle is lightweight, performant, typesafe, non-lactose, gluten-free, sober, flexible and **serverless-ready by design**.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with automatic type inference
- ⚡ **Performant** - Lightweight at ~7.4kb minified+gzipped with zero dependencies
- 🌳 **Tree-shakeable** - Only include what you use
- 🔄 **Dual API** - Both SQL-like and relational query APIs
- 🚀 **Serverless-ready** - Works seamlessly in serverless environments
- 🗄️ **Multi-database** - Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SingleStore

## Why Drizzle?

### SQL-like Approach
**If you know SQL, you know Drizzle.**

Other ORMs tend to deviate from or abstract away SQL, leading to a double learning curve. Drizzle is the opposite - it embraces SQL while providing TypeScript safety.

### Headless Architecture
Drizzle is designed to be a thin typed layer on top of SQL. You have full control over your queries while enjoying the benefits of type safety and developer experience.

## Supported Databases

- **PostgreSQL** - Full support with pg, postgres.js, node-postgres
- **MySQL** - Compatible with MySQL 5.7+ and MySQL 8+
- **SQLite** - Works with better-sqlite3, bun:sqlite, and more
- **SingleStore** - Full compatibility with SingleStore databases

## Getting Started

Install Drizzle ORM and Drizzle Kit:

```bash
npm i drizzle-orm
npm i -D drizzle-kit
```

Define your schema:

```typescript
import { pgTable, serial, text, integer } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
  age: integer('age'),
});
```

Query your database:

```typescript
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { users } from './schema';

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

// SQL-like query
const allUsers = await db.select().from(users);

// Relational query
const result = await db.query.users.findMany();
```

## Core Concepts
